    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">July 14, 2025 · by CloudSia Team</p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        We started CloudSia with one goal: to make AI useful for everyday creators. While big tech builds for enterprise
        APIs,
        we’re focused on tools that help teachers, students, musicians, and local creators.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        From voice tools to smart lesson planners — our roadmap is about empowerment, not complexity. We believe the
        next generation
        of AI products must be simple, personal, and made for all.
